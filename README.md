## 1. Introduction

Pneumonia is a disease in which the air sacs in one or both lungs get infected and inflame. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Diseases such as Pneumonia are responsible for over 1 million hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths a year in the US alone. Currently radiologists use Chest X-Rays to detect diseases such as Pneumonia. Other diseases detected in this manner include Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Effusion, Pleural Thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Hernia, Mass. Once detected, the patient can be treated. However if the disease is not detected at an early stage, the consequences can be severe. 

Luckily Deep Learning networks can be trained to detect diseases and assist medical personel. In fact Deep Learning networks can be trained to detect diseases such as Pneumonia with greater accuracy than any human radiologist from chest X-Rays. Therfore, through decreasing human error in detection, countless lives can be saved!

Further an estimated two thirds of the global population lacks access to radiology diagnostics. These diagnostics include as mentioned above detection of diseases. With the automation of radiology experts, healthcare delivery can be improved and access to medical imaging expertise can be increased in many parts of the world. Therefore, through automating radiology experts, many parts of the world will gain radiology diagnostics and countless lives can be saved!
