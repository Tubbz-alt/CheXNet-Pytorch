## 1. Introduction

Pneumonia is a disease in which the air sacs in one or both lungs get infected and inflame. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Diseases such as Pneumonia are responsible for over 1 million hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths a year in the US alone. Currently radiologists use Chest X-Rays to detect diseases such as Pneumonia. Once detected, the patient can be treated. However if the disease is not detected at an early stage, the consequences can be severe. 

Luckily Deep Learning networks can be trained to detect diseases and assist medical personel. In fact Deep Learning networks can be trained to detect diseases such as Pneumonia with greater accuracy than any human radiologist from chest X-Rays, thus saving lives.

With approximately 2 billion procedures per year, chest X-rays are the most common imaging examination tool used in practice, critical for screening, diagnosis, and management of diseases including pneumonia. However, an estimated two thirds of the global population lacks access to radiology diagnostics. With automation at the level of experts, we hope that this technology can improve healthcare delivery and increase access to medical imaging expertise in parts of the world where access to skilled radiologists is limited.
